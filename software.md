# Software

The software section of this project could be done in Arduino IDE, but our advice is to use [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html){:target="_blank"} in VS Code to program the ESP32.
You need these two libraries:
- Adafruit_GFX.h
- Adafruit_SSD1306.h
  
Both can easily be installed within PlatformIO.
