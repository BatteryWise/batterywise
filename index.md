# Battery**<span style="color:green;">Wise</span>**

Welcome to our sustainable project within the course **Engineering & Sustainability**. In this project, we've developed a simple and easy-to-recreate batterytester. Our focus lies in raising awareness for battery disposal, to reduce as much electronic waste as possible.
