# Battery**<span style="color:green;">Wise</span>**

Welcome to **BatteryWise**, a sustainable project within **Engineering & Sustainability**.  
In this project, we've developed a simple and easy-to-recreate batterytester. Our focus lies in raising awareness for battery disposal, to reduce as much electronic waste as possible.
